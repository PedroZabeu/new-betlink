# Task: EPIC 1 Overview and Preparation

## Context
We're starting EPIC 1 of the BetLink project. Your role is to understand the project structure and be ready to test features as Claude implements them.

## Your Task

### 1. Read and Understand
Please read these files in order:
1. `/CLAUDE.md` - Overall project guidelines
2. `/docs/master-plan.md` - Complete project roadmap
3. `/docs/epics/epic-1-base-system/definition.md` - EPIC 1 details
4. `/docs/features/planning/feature-1-1-plan.md` - First feature plan

### 2. Verify Environment
Run these commands and report status:
```bash
# Check Node version
node --version

# Check if project runs
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000 and describe what you see
```

### 3. Check Supabase Connection
1. Check if `.env.local` exists and has:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
2. Report if these are configured (don't share the actual values)

### 4. Prepare for Testing
Familiarize yourself with:
- The current tutorial components that will be removed
- The auth pages at `/auth/login` and `/auth/sign-up`
- The protected page at `/protected`
