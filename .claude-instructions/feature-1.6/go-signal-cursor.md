## Status: READY TO START ✅

Claude has completed his part of Feature 1.6:
- ✅ Blog page created at `/app/blog/page.tsx`
- ✅ About page created at `/app/sobre/page.tsx`
- ✅ Cookie consent banner implemented and added to layout

## Your Task: Create Terms and Privacy Pages

Please follow the instructions in:
`.cursor-instructions/feature-1.6/task-20250125-compliance-pages.md`

### Quick Summary:
1. Create `/app/termos/page.tsx` - Terms of Service page
2. Create `/app/privacidade/page.tsx` - Privacy Policy page
3. Both pages should use the Header component from `@/components/header`
4. Include table of contents with smooth scroll
5. Use professional layout for legal text

### Important Notes:
- The Header component is already imported and working in Blog and About pages
- Follow the same pattern for consistent layout
- Make sure both pages are responsive
- Test anchor links for smooth scrolling
